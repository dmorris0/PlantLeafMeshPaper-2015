Plant phenotyping is an emerging science that assess plant growth and development from the interactions between genetic variations and environments. Automatic plant phenotyping relies on sensors to measure plant leaf shape and pose in limited growth space.

We propose a new method to significantly improve the accuracy of plant phenotyping by detecting and modeling the leaf $3$D surface with inexpensive close-range time-of-flight RGB-D sensors. While these sensors provide dense depth, the noise in the depth is large compared to the surface features, making high-fidelity surface estimation challenging.  Our method seeks to maximize the resolution and accuracy of the estimated surface by combining features from multiple modalities of the sensor including dense depth, near infra-red reflectance, and color.  The result is an automated surface mesh that captures leaf boundary and shape information and filters out much of the noise.  Experimental results on known shapes and real plant data show that our method is clearly better than the existing solutions.

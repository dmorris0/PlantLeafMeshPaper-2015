%Introduction here including application description

3D modeling of plant leaf canopy is a challenging computer vision problem [REF]. Solving this problem enables biological researchers to non-invasively phenotype plant growth and productivity [REF], which is critical to identify genes that can increase crop performance [REF].

To this end, we develop a new plant leaf mesh construction algorithm using data from RGB-D sensors. Specifically, ...

\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

This work presents a new method for estimating high fidelity plant leaf surfaces from RGB-D data.  Our mesh model is flexible enough to capture a wide variety of complex leaf surfaces, and at the same time can filter out significant depth noise from the sensor.  Robustness to noise is achieved by constraining the mesh vertices to fit along the color pixel rays, by minimizing the depth error, and through a curvature-based regularization term.  Results show significant improvement in shape estimation of complex leaves over alternative methods that use voxel models and that use single-leaf geometric primitives. Our future work will involve dealing with overlapping leaves and dense foliage in more cluttered background by using more robust segmentation and leaf detection techniques. We also plan to characterize the mesh region in $3$D world with green pigments and photosynthetic rates by using data from florescent and other high fidelity cameras keeping it adjacent to RGB-D sensors. We anticipate this method will enable automated plant growth observation and further research into improved crop varieties.

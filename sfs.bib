  abstract = {A novel short wave imaging technique is described. For the first time,
	it is capable of measuring the wave height and wave slope simultaneously
	with unprecedented accuracy. A telecentric optical system is used
	to image the waves so that the image magnification does not change
	with the wave height and the slope calibration is much less dependent
	on the position of the image. A telecentric illumination system contains
	an area-extended LED light source that is placed in the focal plane
	of a second lens below the water channel. In this way, the wave slope
	can be coded by the position-dependent intensity of the light source.
	LEDs with two different wavelengths in the red and near infrared
	part of the spectrum are used. Because the water column absorbs the
	two wavelengths differently, the difference in the observed intensities
	gives the wave height. The paper details the principle of the technique
	and the calibration procedures.},

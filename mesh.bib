abstract = "This paper describes the development of a prototype system using fuzzy logic concept for constructing a feature human model, which is to be stored in a 3D digital human model database. In our approach, the feature human model is constructed by unorganized cloud points obtained from 3D laser scanners. Firstly, noisy points are removed, and the orientation of the human model is adjusted; secondly, a feature based mesh generation algorithm is applied on the cloud points to construct the mesh surface of a human model; lastly, semantic features of the human model are extracted from the mesh surface. Compared with earlier approach, our method strongly preserves the topology of a human model; more details can be constructed; and both the robustness and the efficiency of the algorithm are improved. At the end of the paper, in order to demonstrate the functionality of feature human models, potential applications are given. "

abstract = "The paper presents a set of mesh smoothing tools developed to increase mesh regularity, reduce oversmoothing, and enhance crease lines. Mesh smoothing with simultaneous increasing mesh regularity and reducing oversmoothing is achieved by combining together the Laplacian flow and a mesh evolution by a function of the mean curvature. To enhance salient ridge and ravine structures we use a coupled nonlinear diffusion of the mesh normals and vertices. "

abstract = "In this paper, we propose a sharpness dependent filter design based on the fairing of surface normal, whereby the filtering algorithm automatically selects a filter. This may be a mean-filter, a min-filter, or a filter ranked between these two, depending on the local sharpness value and the sharpness dependent weighting function selected. To recover the original shape of a noisy model, the algorithm selects a mean-filter for flat regions and a min-filter for distinguished sharp regions. The selected sharpness dependent weighting function has a Gaussian, Laplacian, or El Fallah Ford form that approximately fits the sharpness distribution found in all tested noisy models. We use a sharpness factor in the weighting function to control the degree of feature preserving. The appropriate sharpness factor can be obtained by sharpness analysis based on the Bayesian classification. Our experiment results demonstrate that the proposed sharpness dependent filter is superior to other approaches for smoothing a polygon mesh, as well as for preserving its sharp features. "

abstract = "The aim of this paper is to present a method to generate computational, geometric models of 3D objects defined in the form of a ‘cloud of points’ (CoP). These objects can then be discretized for subsequent finite element analyses. Various procedures required to achieve this are briefly described, including the mathematical representation of an integrated image acquisition/modelling system, which allows for the automatic creation of accurate geometric models of either scanned images of objects or of CoP generally, as well as the mesh generation algorithm employed. The application of this combined method is then demonstrated with respect to modelling human organs and agricultural objects. The main emphasis of the paper is on the wide applicability of the developed techniques. "

abstract = "This paper describes the development of a prototype system using fuzzy logic concept for constructing a feature human model, which is to be stored in a 3D digital human model database. In our approach, the feature human model is constructed by unorganized cloud points obtained from 3D laser scanners. Firstly, noisy points are removed, and the orientation of the human model is adjusted; secondly, a feature based mesh generation algorithm is applied on the cloud points to construct the mesh surface of a human model; lastly, semantic features of the human model are extracted from the mesh surface. Compared with earlier approach, our method strongly preserves the topology of a human model; more details can be constructed; and both the robustness and the efficiency of the algorithm are improved. At the end of the paper, in order to demonstrate the functionality of feature human models, potential applications are given. "

Mesh smoothing with simultaneous increasing mesh regularity and reducing oversmoothing is achieved by combining together the Laplacian flow and a mesh evolution by a function of the mean curvature. To enhance salient ridge and ravine structures we use a coupled nonlinear diffusion of the mesh normals and vertices. "

abstract = "In this paper, we propose a sharpness dependent filter design based on the fairing of surface normal, whereby the filtering algorithm automatically selects a filter. This may be a mean-filter, a min-filter, or a filter ranked between these two, depending on the local sharpness value and the sharpness dependent weighting function selected. To recover the original shape of a noisy model, the algorithm selects a mean-filter for flat regions and a min-filter for distinguished sharp regions. The selected sharpness dependent weighting function has a Gaussian, Laplacian, or El Fallah Ford form that approximately fits the sharpness distribution found in all tested noisy models. We use a sharpness factor in the weighting function to control the degree of feature preserving. The appropriate sharpness factor can be obtained by sharpness analysis based on the Bayesian classification. Our experiment results demonstrate that the proposed sharpness dependent filter is superior to other approaches for smoothing a polygon mesh, as well as for preserving its sharp features. "

These objects can then be discretized for subsequent finite element analyses. Various procedures required to achieve this are briefly described, including the mathematical representation of an integrated image acquisition/modelling system, which allows for the automatic creation of accurate geometric models of either scanned images of objects or of CoP generally, as well as the mesh generation algorithm employed. The application of this combined method is then demonstrated with respect to modelling human organs and agricultural objects. The main emphasis of the paper is on the wide applicability of the developed techniques. "

It extends fairing approaches that use only first order neighborhoods and allows to assume arbitrary local spectral properties of the mesh geometry.

 year={2011},

 pages={3408-3414}, 
 abstract={Supervision of long-lasting extensive botanic experiments is a promising robotic application that some recent technological advances have made feasible. Plant modelling for this application has strong demands, particularly in what concerns 3D information gathering and speed. This paper shows that Time-of-Flight (ToF) cameras achieve a good compromise between both demands, providing a suitable complement to color vision. A new method is proposed to segment plant images into their composite surface patches by combining hierarchical color segmentation with quadratic surface fitting using ToF depth data. Experimentation shows that the interpolated depth maps derived from the obtained surfaces fit well the original scenes. Moreover, candidate leaves to be approached by a measuring instrument are ranked, and then robot-mounted cameras move closer to them to validate their suitability to being sampled. Some ambiguities arising from leaves overlap or occlusions are cleared up in this way. The work is a proof-of-concept that dense color data combined with sparse depth as provided by a ToF camera yields a good enough 3D approximation for automated plant measuring at the high throughput imposed by the application.},
